                    <p>
                        When it comes to helping others, small acts can make a big difference. Sometimes we just need a nudge. And as we help others, we discover we also help ourselves - doing good feels good!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ripple is full of manageable, accessible suggestions to get you started. Add your own suggestions and share them with the Ripple community. Track your own progress, and see the total impact too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we each do our bit, we create a Ripple effect. Doing good feels good.

                            Ripple is built to protect your privacy from the ground-up. When you first install Ripple, it downloads the latest library from the cloud, and continues to receive library updates on an ongoing basis. None of your data is shared during this process and this functionality does not require any account creation or sign-in.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item bg-light">
                            You can also add your own personal ripples to your library. These are stored locally on your device and not shared with anyone unless you give consent (see 5). You can edit or hide any ripple in your library - both those downloaded from the cloud and your own additions. You can erase your library and restore the latest version of the cloud library by selecting Edit -> Reset Library in the Library tab. If you are signed into your iCloud account (see 4), then your sychronized library is also reset in your private iCloud account.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item bg-light">
                            Each time you complete a ripple, this history is added to your personal history on your device. Your activity is not shared with anyone unless you give your consent (see 6). You can delete items in your personal history through the 'Me' sheet in the Stats tab. If you are signed into your iCloud account (see 4), then the synchronised records are also deleted from your private iCloud account.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item bg-light">
                            If you are signed into an iCloud account, and iCloud is enabled for Ripple in your device settings, then your ripple library and history will synchronize across your other devices signed into your iCloud account. This data is stored securely in your private iCloud account, and no one else has access to it.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item bg-light">
                            When you add a personal ripple to your library, you have the option to ’Suggest to others.’ If you choose this option, your ripple is immediately added to your own library, and additionally is passed to the developer for consideration for inclusion in the cloud library. If the developer approves your suggestion, then you will receive a notification, and all users will receive your suggestion in their libraries too. You can optionally add an author to your ripple suggestion. You can choose whatever value you like here, for example, it could just be your first name or a nickname. There is no requirement for the author value to identify you and it doesn't need to be unique.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item bg-light">
                            The first time you complete a ripple, in addition to storing this in your own history, you are also prompted whether you want to share your activity in community statistics. If you choose to do so, your history is also added to the community history, accessible to all users through the ‘Everyone’ sheet in the Stats tab. No information which can identify you is shared and it is not possible for other users or the developer to link community history to a particular user. You can change your choice at any time in Settings. You can delete contributions you have previously made to the community history through the 'Everyone' sheet in the Stats tab. This removes the record from your device and from the cloud, but not other user devices if your activity has already been sychronized with the device.
                        </li>

                            You can delete all app data stored locally on your device entirely by uninstalling the app from your device. You can delete all app data stored locally and the records synchronized in your private iCloud account by selecting Settings -> Your Name -> iCloud -> Manage Storage -> Ripple.
