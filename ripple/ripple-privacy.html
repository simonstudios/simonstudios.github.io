                                Ripple is built to protect your privacy from the ground-up. When you first install Ripple, it
                                downloads the latest library from the cloud, and continues to receive library updates on an
                                ongoing basis. None of your data is shared during this process and this functionality does not
                                require any account creation or sign-in.

                                You can also add your own personal ripples to your library. These are stored locally on your
                                device and not shared with anyone unless you give consent (see 5). You can edit or hide any
                                ripple in your library - both those downloaded from the cloud and your own additions. You can
                                erase your library and restore the latest version of the cloud library by selecting Edit ->
                                Reset Library in the Library tab. If you are signed into your iCloud account (see 4), then your
                                sychronized library is also reset in your private iCloud account.
                            </li>

                                Each time you complete a ripple, this history is added to your personal history on your device.
                                Your activity is not shared with anyone unless you give your consent (see 6). You can delete
                                items in your personal history through the 'Me' sheet in the Stats tab. If you are signed into
                                your iCloud account (see 4), then the synchronised records are also deleted from your private
                                iCloud account.

                                If you are signed into an iCloud account, and iCloud is enabled for Ripple in your device
                                settings, then your ripple library and history will synchronize across your other devices signed
                                into your iCloud account. This data is stored securely in your private iCloud account, and no
                                one else has access to it.
                            </li>

                                When you add a personal ripple to your library, you have the option to ’Suggest to others.’ If
                                you choose this option, your ripple is immediately added to your own library, and additionally
                                is passed to the developer for consideration for inclusion in the cloud library. If the
                                developer approves your suggestion, then you will receive a notification, and all users will
                                receive your suggestion in their libraries too. You can optionally add an author to your ripple
                                suggestion. You can choose whatever value you like here, for example, it could just be your
                                first name or a nickname. There is no requirement for the author value to identify you and it
                                doesn't need to be unique.

                                The first time you complete a ripple, in addition to storing this in your own history, you are
                                also prompted whether you want to share your activity in community statistics. If you choose to
                                do so, your history is also added to the community history, accessible to all users through the
                                ‘Everyone’ sheet in the Stats tab. No information which can identify you is shared and it is not
                                possible for other users or the developer to link community history to a particular user. You
                                can change your choice at any time in Settings. You can delete contributions you have previously
                                made to the community history through the 'Everyone' sheet in the Stats tab. This removes the
                                record from your device and from the cloud, but not other user devices if your activity has
                                already been sychronized with the device.

                                You can delete all app data stored locally on your device entirely by uninstalling the app from

                                private iCloud account by selecting Settings -> Your Name -> iCloud -> Manage Storage -> Ripple.
